# Serve
```bash
cd c/out
python3 -m http.server
```



# emcc compile
```bash
cd /src/wasm-packet-dissector/c
NOOPT=1 make
```

# linking against glib
on node 14, I can run this:

```bash
node --experimental-wasm-threads ./node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js --runInBand --no-cache src/test/test_basic.ts
```

# Linking against anything
If there are things I can link outright to, that just work from wireshark I should
I should only hand edit the "important files" and hand build them myself from inside the wasm


# Keywords
WWPD - wireshark wasm packet dissector, used for notes aka fixme


# Notes about race-condition at startup
```
Racecondition between module loading and first test running
"Another option is to use the MODULARIZE option, using -sMODULARIZE. That puts all of the generated JavaScript into a factory function, which you can call to create an instance of your module. The factory function returns a Promise that resolves with the module instance. The promise is resolved once itâ€™s safe to call the compiled code, i.e. after the compiled code has been downloaded and instantiated. For example, if you build with -sMODULARIZE -s 'EXPORT_NAME="createMyModule"', then you can do this:

createMyModule(/* optional default settings */).then(function(Module) {
  // this is reached when everything is ready, and you can call methods on Module
});"
